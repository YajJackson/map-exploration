To run this app, you can use [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) (which can be installed via `npm install -g parcel-bundler`).

You will also need to include your own Google Maps API key. Instructions for obtaining one can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#step-1-get-an-api-key).
